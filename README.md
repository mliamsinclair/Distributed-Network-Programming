# Distributed Networking Projects

This repository contains various distributed networking projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects of distributed systems and networking. Below is a brief description of each project:

## Distributed Seat Reservation System

A distributed system for reserving seats in a venue. Users can select seats and make reservations, while the system ensures that no two users can reserve the same seat simultaneously.

## Distributed Seat Reservation System with Scheduling Algorithm

An extension of the previous seat reservation system, this project incorporates a scheduling algorithm to optimize seat allocation. The algorithm considers factors such as seat availability, user preferences, and real-time updates to provide an efficient reservation experience.

## Distributed Voting System

A distributed system for conducting secure and transparent voting processes. The system ensures that each vote is counted accurately and maintains the integrity of the voting process.

## Peer-to-Peer Group Chat System

A decentralized group chat system where users can join different chat groups and communicate with each other. The system ensures reliable message delivery and privacy.

## Question and Answer Contest System

A system for conducting question and answer contests. Users can submit questions, participate in answering questions, and earn points based on their performance. The system handles question distribution, answer validation, and leaderboard management.

## Multithreaded Merge Sorting Script

A script that demonstrates the use of multithreading to perform merge sorting on a large dataset. The script divides the dataset into smaller chunks, sorts them concurrently using multiple threads, and merges the sorted chunks to produce the final sorted result.
